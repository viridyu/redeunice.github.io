### abstract

We propose a novel deep neural network architecture for semi-supervised semantic segmentation using heterogeneous annotations. Contrary to existing approaches posing semantic segmentation as region-based classification, our algorithm decouples classification and segmentation, and learns a separate network for each task. In this architecture, labels associated with an image are identified by classification network, and binary segmentation is subsequently performed for each identified label by segmentation network. The decoupled architecture enables us to learn classification and segmentation networks separately based on the training data with **image-level and pixel-wise class labels**, respectively. It facilitates to **reduce search space** for segmentation effectively by exploiting class-specific activation maps obtained from bridging layers. Our algorithm shows outstanding performance compared to other semi-supervised approaches even with much less training images with strong annotations in PASCAL VOC dataset.

## Densely Dilated Spatial Pooling Convolutional Network using benign loss functions for imbalanced volumetric prostate segmentation

### abstract

The high incidence rate of prostate disease poses a requirement in early detection for diagnosis. As one of the main imaging methods used for prostate cancer detection, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has wide range of appearance and imbalance problems, making automated prostate segmentation fundamental but challenging. Here we propose a novel Densely Dilated Spatial Pooling Convolutional Network (DDSP ConNet) in encoder-decoder structure. It employs dense structure to combine dilated convolution and global pooling, thus supplies coarse segmentation results from encoder and decoder subnet and preserves more contextual information. To obtain richer hierarchical feature maps, residual long connection is furtherly adopted to fuse contexture features. Meanwhile, we adopt DSC loss and Jaccard loss functions to train our DDSP ConNet. We surprisingly found and proved that, in contrast to re-weighted cross entropy, DSC loss and Jaccard loss have a lot of benign properties in theory, including symmetry, continuity and differentiability about the parameters of network. Extensive experiments on the MICCAI PROMISE12 challenge dataset have been done to corroborate the effectiveness of our DDSP ConNet with DSC loss and Jaccard loss. Totally, our method achieves a score of 85.78 in the test dataset, outperforming most of other competitors.
