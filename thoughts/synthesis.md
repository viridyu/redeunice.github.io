> When I use full_cycle, the l1 loss is hard to converage to the value for the half_cycle (5 vs 1). Whereas the gan loss could converage quickly. So the gan loss and l1 loss are not balanced. What if I set the hyper-paramater for l1 loss larger? Can it make the two kinds of losses converage at the same time? Another experiment is needed to prove this thought.
